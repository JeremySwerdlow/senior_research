# Post-train Data Addition to Decision Trees in Python
### Jeremy Swerdlow
This is a repo to store all relevant documents to my senior research project on the addition of data to decision trees after their initial training, and the impact thereof.

While this work is still in progress, the core code is close to complete. It all functions, now just requires tweaking for neatness and comments. 

To run the sample code, please use the .ipynb file.

If you have any questions, please email Jeremy Swerdlow at [jjswerd14@earlham.edu](mailto:jjswerd14@earlham.edu)
